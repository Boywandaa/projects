        <i>Wait a minute
        I think I left my conscience on your front doorstep
        Woah-oh, woah-oh
        Wait a minute
        
        I think I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
        But I'm here right now (right now), right now (right now)
        Just sitting in a cloud, oh-wow
        I'm here right now (right now), right now with you, oh-wow, oh-wow
        I don't even care
        I'll run my hands through your hair
        You wanna run your fingers through mine
        But my dreads too thick and that's alright
        
        Hold on, wait a minute
        Feel my heart's intention, oh
        Hold on, wait a minute
        I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
        Left my soul in his vision
        Let's go get it, ah, ah
        Let's go get it, ah, ah
        
        Some tings don't work
        Some tings are bound to be
        Some tings, they hurt
        And they tear apart me
        You left your diary at my house
        And I read those pages
        Do you really love me, baby?
        
        Some tings don't work
        Some tings are bound to be
        Some tings, they hurt
        And they tear apart me
        But I broke my word
        And you were bound to see
        And I cried at the curb
        When you first said, "Oel ngati kameie"
        
        Hold on, wait a minute
        Feel my heart's intention, oh
        Hold on, wait a minute
        I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
        Left my soul in his vision
        Let's go get it, ah, ah
        Let's go get it, ah, ah
        
        Some people like to live
        Some just tryin' to get by
        Some people like that hurt, ooh
        Some just rather say goodbye, bye
       
        Hold on, wait a minute
        Feel my heart's intention, oh
        Hold on, wait a minute
        I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
        Left my soul in his vision
        Let's go get it, ah, ah
        Let's go get it, ah, ah </i>
